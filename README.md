SnnDM: A Denoising Model for Single-ParticleCryo-EM Images based on Siamese Neural Network

In this project, we propose a new unsupervised method, named SnnDM, which is an iterative method combining Siamese neural network with K-means clustering. SnnDM first utilizes trained ResNet18 to extract the image features and generates pre-label for each image. In each iteration, the Siamese neural network is trained by the contrastive loss function, and updates the feature matrix of each image. After each iteration, the new label for each image is generated by K-means clustering method. The denoising performance for SnnDM is tested by multiple data sets and also compared with other denosing methods. The experimental results show that the SnnDM significantly improves the signal-to-noise-ratio of cryo-EM images. Moreover, the cluster mean images processed by SnnDM lead to better initial 3D models compared with the mainstream reconstruction tools.
